## ⚙️ Project Flow: How It Works

1. **Upload a PDF Medical Report**
   The user uploads a scanned or digital PDF. If text cannot be extracted, OCR is used as fallback.

2. **Text Extraction and Chunking**
   The PDF is parsed, and its content is split into overlapping text chunks.

3. **Embedding Creation**
   Each chunk is embedded using a Sentence Transformer (MiniLM) and stored in Pinecone.

4. **User Asks a Question**
   The user types a question about the report in any Indian language or lets the system auto-detect.

5. **Query Embedding + Vector Search**
   The user's question is embedded and matched against the most relevant chunks in Pinecone.

6. **Gemini Response Generation**
   The retrieved context and user query are sent to Gemini 2.5 for an answer in English.

7. **Translation to Target Language**
   If the selected language is not English, the response is translated using Google Translate API.

8. **Response Delivery via Chatbot UI**
   The user sees the final answer with language tag and chat history.

> 🔹 Built with empathy for patients across linguistic borders.
